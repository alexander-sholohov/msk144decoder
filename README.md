### MSK144 Stream Decoder.

**Input:** Reads audio stream from stdin. Format: 12000 samples per second, 16 bits signed, mono.  
**Output:** Prints decoded lines to stdout, optionally writes log files and posts results to a specific HTTP service.  

Despite the repository has name msk144* it also includes jt65decoder and q65decoder. These decoders act in the similar way. They accept infinite stream at input, start recording at proper T/R interval, feed the consumed stream to decoder, repeat that process again in the loop.

**How to compile:**

Prereqirements:

```shell
sudo apt-get install build-essential
sudo apt-get install cmake
sudo apt-get install gfortran
sudo apt-get install libfftw3-dev
sudo apt-get install libboost-dev
sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev

```

The project utilizes original WSJT decoder. WSJTX repository linked as git submodule.  
After cloning this repository, execute the following commands:
```shell
cd msk144decoder
git submodule init
git submodule update --progress
```

Commands to build:
```shell
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . 
```

Executable file *msk144decoder* will appear at the current directory.

To install the binaries for system-wide use, you can additionally run the following command:

```shell
sudo cmake --install .
```

(`sudo` can be omitted if run as root)

Wav-file reading example:
```shell
cat ../demo/000000_000001.wav | ./msk144decoder
# Actually, when using cat command the wav header is also read. Not a big problem for decoder.
```

Get brief help:
```shell
./msk144decoder --help

./jt65decoder --help

./q65decoder --help
```

Getting stream from rtl_tcp example:
```shell
nc 192.168.1.200 2223 | ./csdr convert_u8_f | ./csdr shift_addition_cc 0.312451171875 | ./csdr fir_decimate_cc 64 0.005 HAMMING | ./csdr bandpass_fir_fft_cc 0.0 0.12 0.06 | ./csdr realpart_cf | ./csdr rational_resampler_ff 3 8 | ./csdr gain_ff 100.0 | ./csdr limit_ff | ./csdr convert_f_s16 | ./msk144decoder
```

Script *./scripts/generate_cmd_line.py* will help you build csdr commands chain. Just make necessary changes in it and run.
```shell
cd scripts
python generate_cmd_line.py
```
